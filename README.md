About Video Games sales analysis
Briefly, I found that there was a significant increase in video game sales in the late 1990s and early 2000s, certain genres consistently had high sales figures,
and sales were impacted by major events. These insights are important for industry stakeholders to make informed business decisions.
During my analysis of video game sales using Power BI, I was able to uncover several insights and hidden patterns in the data. One of the key findings was that there
was a significant increase in the overall sales of video games in the late 1990s and early 2000s. This can be attributed to the widespread adoption of gaming consoles
during that time period, which made video games more accessible and popular among consumers.
Additionally, I noticed that certain genres consistently had high sales figures, while others saw fluctuations in popularity over the years.
For example, sports and action games consistently had high sales, while adventure games saw a decline in popularity in the early 2000s before experiencing a
resurgence in the mid-2010s.
Another interesting insight was that the sales of video games were largely impacted by major events, such as the release of new gaming consoles or major franchises.
For example, the sales of video games increased significantly following the release of the Nintendo Switch console in 2017,
while the release of popular franchises like Call of Duty and FIFA also had a significant impact on sales figures.
Overall, these insights provide valuable information for industry stakeholders, as they can use this data to make informed business decisions.
Understanding the trends and patterns in video game sales can help companies to better market and develop their products, ultimately leading to increased profits
and success in the industry.
